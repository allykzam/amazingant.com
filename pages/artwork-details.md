title: Artwork Details
date: 2016-05-16 18:38

My site currently uses a handful of different images. Some of them are mine,
some of them aren't. Here's a list of them, and information about them!


### Alakazam pixel art

![Alakazam pixel art][alakazam]

This pixel art of the Pokémon character Alakazam is based on some of the results
I saw when searching for "alakazam pixel art" on the Internet, and has the same
pixel arrangement as most of the matching images I saw. I don't think the colors
match any of them perfectly? I built this image myself, but as I said, it pretty
well matches existing artwork. Trademarks for Pokémon and (possibly?) Alakazam
belong to The Pokémon Company.


### My Avatar

I created this pixel art myself with a blurry photo of one of my old Pokémon
games. Given the screen capture ability in the current handhelds, I could
probably fix any inaccuracies, but I'm happy with it. The original artwork that
I attempted to duplicate came from Pokémon Yellow; the original artwork, the
game Pokémon Yellow, and the trademark Pokémon, all belong to The Pokémon
Company.


### Site Background

This fun little circuit-board background is something I threw together for this
site. Was kinda fun.


### Gir

![Gir][gir]

Hooray for Invader Zim! I'm not sure what to label this, because it sounds like
Invader Zim is trademark/copyright/whatever to Nickelodeon, but I can't find out
for sure what it is. This image is based on some pixel art I found on the 'net,
and I don't think it perfectly matches anyone else's?
